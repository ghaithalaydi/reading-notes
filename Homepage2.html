<li>Did you also think they were called html tags? well infact 2 tags opening and closing make up an element... get your glossary in order :)</li>
<li>In the discovery phase, you need to understand and have a good understanding of the purpose for which your making your website (things to consider would include who, when and why would your website be visited)</li>
<li>Here is another fact better explained, article & section elements are used for parts of the webpage just like this part here that could be called a stand alone informative section </li>
<li>Did you know you could have an entire article linked to a specific link by using the link element and then adding an article element inside of it?... cool huh?</li>
