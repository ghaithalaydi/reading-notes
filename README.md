# **Growth mindset**
in my modest opinion is what diffrentiates a slacker from a go getter. I also believe the first step on the long journey of growth would be to simple step out of your comfort zone and let your brain sweat, this in combination with hardwork and perseverance is what will get you your jump start and also catalyze the process 

## So my notes to self would be:
1.focus 
2.calm down 
3.it will all work out eventually
